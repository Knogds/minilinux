I created this tiny distro so it would work on my ancient laptops. It worked on my HP 486 with 4MB ram and I could without any problems use Vim on it. Compiled using the latest versions at the time: Linux 4.0.2 and Vim 7.4.333 (somwhere in 2015).
It is not complete, but working, use root to login, without password. It is compiled with config file into /proc so u can use it to develop it further, for newer kernels.
